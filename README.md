# Data Summary

#### Main Data Sourcing

This is an external data source. The data was provided by the World Trade Organization. This data is trustworthy because it comes from an established and recognized organization.

https://stats.wto.org/

#### Data Collection


The WTO has available on their website quantitative data in relation to economics and trade policy issues. Its databases and publications provide access to data on trade flows, tariffs, non-tariff measures (NTMs) and trade in value added.


The source of this data is the UN Comtrade, the International Monetary Fund, Eurostat, and additional national sources. If needed, the WTO will complement reported data with estimations. The data is updated in April and October each year. This update includes the total values that are broken down into the necessary economies and groups. 


#### Data Contents


This data includes monthly, quarterly in annual dollar values per type of merchandise of exported and imported by country. The dollar value is in millions of dollars and the years included are 2018 – 2021.


I have chosen this data set because it contains a large amount of the data I will need for this project. It gives a descriptive over all view of what countries have imported and exported over the last three year and the type of merchandise.

#### Data Profile


There are 30,085 rows and 24 columns. Data is updated and includes 2018-2021 

Mixed-type columns


I have found some mixed type columns however the only type of mix is when there is one type of integer, and the other is blanks. I will leave this information as is as I will not need this information for all countries and types of merchandise. 


Missing Data


The missing data shown is for the same columns that have mixed data types except for the Text Values which only includes blanks. As stated previously, I will leave these as there is not need to address. 


Duplicates


There were no duplicate rows

#### Limitations and ethics. 

Outline any limitations and ethical considerations presented by the content of your data, its source, and/or how it was collected.


I believe the biggest limitation when you are looking at this many countries full import and export totals, there is a change that a lot of product goes unreported. Especially in countries where is not a lot of regulation or high in crime. This non-reporting would be amplified with the pandemic going on and the increase in prices and decrease in supply. 


I do not think there would be any ethical considerations as the type of merchandise reviewed is on a higher level so specific products may not be able to be shown. Also, there is no company or personal information listed so none of this information can be traced back to the importer or exporter. 

#### Main question:

How has Covid 19 impacted international trade?


I will look at the increase and decreases in import and export for a certain list of countries which will include the US. I will compare to 2019 to see the differences. I will also compare with the Covid 19 timeline. The main goal is to see beyond what common knowledge about trade during the pandemic is to find businesses or sectors thriving that we may not be aware of. Or where inventory besides things to fight the pandemic have become more available. 

Additional questions.

Are there countries that have done better in exports and imports then other countries during the pandemic?


Are there certain trading partners that developed a trading relationship during the pandemic that was not previously established? 


What products have increased in import/export for the US that we might not be aware of. 


When were the peaks of the Covid 19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021?¶


Which was the US' biggest trading partner prior to the pandemic?


What products did the US increase its import/export with Canada, Mexico, and South and Central Mexico?


What country did the US increase its % of imports and exports from 2020 to 2021?


What were the businesses that were thriving during the pandemic?


Was there product that the US could not import/export to Canada, Mexico, and South and Central Mexico?
